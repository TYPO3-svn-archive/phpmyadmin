# phpMyAdmin Database Management Utility for TYPO3

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over 
the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB and Drizzle. Frequently 
used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) 
can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly 
execute any SQL statement - see http://www.phpmyadmin.net/

## Requirements and known issues
The included phpMyAdmin 5.0.x contains the latest release of phpMyAdmin. If your need an older version 
compatible with PHP 5.2 and MySQL 5 just use one of the 4.x releases. The 4x releases are supported 
for security fixes only (until Jan 1, 2016).
